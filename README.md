# The-Coding-Train-Exercises
This is a collection of exercises proposed on The Coding Train Youtube channel (https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman) but with a catch: they're implemented in C++ as UWP applications.
# How To Build
You need Windows 10 version 1909 and Visual Studio 2019 16.6. Early versions of Windows and Visual Studio might work but they haven't been tested.
To build the exercises:
- open up *The Coding Train Exercises.sln* solution;
- follow any prompts that might appear to install required dependencies and to enable Developer Mode;
- right click on any project or on the solution itself and select *Build* or *Build Solution*.
# The Exercises
Each exercise is a self-contained project as it doesn't depend on other projects. It can be built and run independently.
## Zoog
This exercise draws an approximation of the alien called Zoog introduced at the end of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2oHuKG_BQc.
## MouseTracker
This exercise draws a line between the current and previous mouse position. The line's thickness changes according to the speed of the mouse. The line's color gets more red as the mouse moves to the right and more blue as the mouse moves downwards. The exercise was proposed at the end of https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibW4oA7-n8I.
